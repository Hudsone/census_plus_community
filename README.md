# CensusPlus Community

CensusPlus Community is a successor of CensusPlus, which provides the functionality that retrieves the current server population of World of Warcraft (just as what CensusPlus did).

Currently, CensusPlus C. is still under development. If you wanted to provide supports, just check the [issues](https://github.com/Hudsone/census_plus_community/issues) tab and pick an item (mail me maybe, I'm still not pretty familiar with Github).

Check [releases](https://github.com/Hudsone/census_plus_community/releases) for the preview & release versions.
