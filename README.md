# CensusPlus Community

CensusPlus is not updating for a long time. Here stores the unofficial version that with the function fixed for retail WOW.

CensusPlus Community is a successor of CensusPlus, which provides the functionality that retrieves the current server population of World of Warcraft (just as what CensusPlus was).

Currently, CensusPlus C. is still under development. If you wanted to provide supports, just check the [issues](https://github.com/Hudsone/census_plus_community/issues) tab and pick an item (mailing me maybe, I'm still not pretty familiar with Github).

Check [releases](https://github.com/Hudsone/census_plus_community/releases) for the preview versions.
